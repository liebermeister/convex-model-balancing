Model balancing code for Matlab and Python
==========================================

[Model balancing](https://www.metabolic-economics.de/model-balancing/index.html) is a computational method to determine consistent states and kinetic constants of metabolic models.

## Dependencies:

  o Matlab utility functions    (https://github.com/liebermeister/matlab-utils)

  o SBML toolbox    (http://sbml.org/Software/SBMLToolbox)

  o SBtab toolbox  (https://github.com/liebermeister/sbtab-matlab)

  o Enzyme cost minimization toolbox  (https://github.com/liebermeister/enzyme-cost-minimization)
