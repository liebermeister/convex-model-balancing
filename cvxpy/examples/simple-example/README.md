Simple example model for model balancing
========================================

The .mat file contains a model structure + artificial data ("measured" kinetic constants and "omics" data for 1 metabolic state), for a toy example. The flux standard deviations are not used in model balancing (but errors caused by the artificial noise in flux data can be assessed)

File provenance: matlab script 'cmb_example_for_cvxpy.m'

Further data:
* SBtab files for the same model are in 'sbtab-files'
* Additional output files from matlab model balancing runs are in 'diagnostic_files'
