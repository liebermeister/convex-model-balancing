Simple example model for model balancing
========================================

The file contains a model structure + artificial data ("measured" kinetic constants and "omics" data for 1 metabolic state), for a toy example. The flux standard deviations are not used in model balancing (but errors caused by the artificial noise in flux data can be assessed)

File provenance: matlab script 'cmb_example_for_cvxpy.m'

Note: later, model (network structure), kinetic "data", and "omics data" may be in separate files (but always as SBtab tables, ie they can be combined into a single file without problems).
